# Simple Login System

## Overview

The Simple Login System is a Python-based application that provides basic user authentication functionalities, including registration and report generation. It allows users to register for an account, log in, and generate reports based on the user's data stored in a MySQL database.

## Features

1. User Registration: New users can create an account by providing their username, email, and password. The system securely stores user credentials in the MySQL database.

2. User Authentication: Registered users can log in to the system using their username and password. The system verifies the user's credentials against the stored data in the database.

3. Report Generation: Upon successful login, users can generate reports based on their data stored in the database. Reports may include user-specific information or aggregated data.

4. Database Connectivity: The system connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve user data. Ensure that you have MySQL installed and configured on your system before running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL database

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
3. Install the required Python dependencies: 
4. Set up the MySQL database:
- Create a new database named 'General_hospital_information'
- Run the SQL script provided in `database_setup.sql` to create the necessary tables.

## Usage

1. Start the application by running the main Python script: 
2. Access the application through your web browser at for example `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Register for a new account by providing your username, email, and password.
4. Log in to the system using your registered username and password.
5. Generate reports based on your data stored in the database.

# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview

The Iris Dataset Analysis project is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that aims to provide insights into the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains information about the petal and sepal sizes of three different species of iris flowers. By implementing a machine learning algorithm, we aim to analyze the dataset and gain valuable insights into the characteristics of each iris species.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of the following attributes:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Class (Species of iris flower)

The dataset contains 150 rows, with each row representing one iris flower instance. There are three classes (species) in the dataset, with 50 instances for each class.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following:
- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Implementation

1. Data Exploration: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Explore features such as distributions, correlations, and summary statistics.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling numerical features if necessary.

3. Feature Engineering: Perform feature selection or extraction techniques to identify the most informative features for model training.

4. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. Common algorithms for this type of dataset include:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  for my case I used K-Nearest neighbours(KNN) model

5. Model Training: Train the selected machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness of the results.
7. Insights Generation: Analyze the model's predictions and generate insights into the characteristics of each iris species based on the model's decision boundaries and feature importances.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`iris_dataset_analysis.ipynb`) in your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each step of the analysis process.
